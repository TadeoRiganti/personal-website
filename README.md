Hello world! 

This will be my very first draft for my personal website. 
Althought I've just finished learning the basics of HTML and a bit of CSS, my idea is to keep it pretty simple, in a minimalistic fashion.

I don't know yet how to write a proper project's documentation, but for now I want to keep a non exhaustive list (althought it will get more specific overtime)of the requisites I think would be cool to implement in the future.  



## REQUIREMENTS

### WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE

#### 1) Landing page

_For business conversion._

1. Elevator's pitch (awareness).
2. Services / benefits (interest).
3. Social proof (with links to the portfolio)
4. Call to action.

#### 2) Portfolio

_The idea is to present my work with a similar treatment as I present them on Behance, but with the advantage of using animations to make it more dynamic._
_However, I'm not sure if separate them into 2 sections or present them in the same page with a filter system._

1. Designer.
2. Developer.

#### 3) About me 

_Ultimately this section serves job-hunting purposes._

1. About me.
2. Skill set.
3. Experience.
4. Downloadable Resume (possibly two types of profiles).

#### 4) Blog

_Professional blog, covering different areas. As a freelance designer, my area of expertise tends to be wider (I like to think is holistic; but really my profile is quite "Generalist")._
_As for the Who, what and how, I'll rely on tag system, because the final idea is to get prospects to suscribe to my newsletter, selecting those topics of their interest._


1. Blog posts.
2. Newsletter subscription (with prefered topics selection if possible).

### OPTIMIZATION

#### A) Mobile first

- Absolute responsive.
- Variable fonts; local hosted to increase performance. 

#### B) Accesibilty

1. Screen reader (Good descriptions for alt text, strength and emphasis tags, etc).
2. Contrast Themes (Outline color of the focus state rather Transparent than 0 px).
3. Color blind themes (/ preferences if possible).
4. Preference reduced motion.

#### C) Keyboard Navigation 

- Focus state visible when an element is selected.

#### D) Light-weight site

- Aiming for a 512 kb / 1MB site. 

#### E) SEO

_Furthermore research is needed._

- Human search: https://humanstxt.org/
- Robot search: https://www.robotstxt.org/

### FEATURES

#### A) Essential

- Hover navigation bar (opaque or glossy effect).
- Themes button; dark / light / color blind / high contrast / font size.
- Variable fonts; weight, style and width. 

#### B) Extras / Experimental

- Model-viewer (because I work on AR/3D solutions).
- "Blog post to Email HTML system subsription" (Don't know if it's a thing, yet).
- "Data visualization / interactive infography feeded with a post tag system" (idem). Now I'm thinking about an interactive infographic connected to a timeline; featuring how I went from a T to Pi-shaped skills, letting users to expand information and link projects... but, on second thought, my inner project manager & developer thinks it's a wat too much for me to handle..
