### personal-website-v1

Hello world! 

This will be my very first draft for my personal website. 
Althought I've just finished learning the basics of HTML and a bit of CSS, my idea is to keep it pretty simple, in a minimalistic fashion.

I don't know yet how to write a proper project's documentation, but for now I want to keep a non exhaustive list (althought it will get more specific overtime)of the requisites I think would be cool to implement in the future.  



## REQUISTES


### Sections

#### Landing page

For business conversion.

1. Elevator's pitch (awareness).
2. Services / benefits (interest).
3. Social proof (with links to the portfolio)
4. Call to action.

#### Portfolio

Maybe separated or with a filter system.

1. Design.
2. Developer.

#### About me (job-hunt)

1. About.
2. Skill set.
3. Downloadable CV (featuring different profiles maybe).
4. Blog (Newsletter)
    a. Blog posts (with a tag system).
    b. Newsletter subscription (with prefered topics selection if possible).


### Optimization

#### Mobile first

- Absolute responsive.

#### Accesibilty

1. Screen reader (Good descriptions for alt text, strength and emphasis tags, etc).
2. Contrast Themes (Outline color of the focus state rather Transparent than 0 px).
3. Color blind themes (/ preferences if possible).
4. Preference reduced motion.

#### Keyboard Navigation 

- (Focus state visible when an element is selected).

#### Light-weight site

- Aiming for a 512 kb / 1MB site. 

#### SEO

...


### Features

- Hover navigation bar (opaque or glossy effect).
- Themes button; dark / light / color blind / high contrast / font size.
- Model-viewer (because I work on AR/3D solutions).
- "Blog post to Email HTML system subsription" (Don't know if it's a thing, yet).
- "Data visualization / interactive infography feeded with a post tag system" (idem). Now I'm thinking about an interactive infographic connected to a timeline; featuring how I went from a T to Pi-shaped skills, letting users to expand information and link projects... but, on second thought, my inner project manager & developer thinks it's a wat too much for me to handle..
