First draft / Brutalist style

Hello there, this will be my very first draft for my personal website. 

As I've just finished learning HTML, I decided to style it first with a minimalistic / brutalist approach. 
Althought I'm starting to learn CSS just now, I'll try add as little as possible; just to make it more user-friendly. 

In future iterations I'll add some websites references for the style / features I would like to implement.

Well, that's all for today. Thanks for reading!
