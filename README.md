# personal-website-v1

Hello world! 

This will be my very first draft for my personal website. 
Althought I've just finished learning the basics of HTML and a bit of CSS, my idea is to keep it pretty simple, in a minimalistic fashion.

I don't know yet how to write a proper project's documentation, but for now I want to keep a non exhaustive list (althought it will get more specific overtime)of the requisites I think would be cool to implement in the future.  



## REQUISTES


# Sections

1. Landing page (business-conversion)
    a. Elevator's pitch (awareness).
    b. Services / benefits (interest).
    c. Social proof (with links to the portfolio)
    d. Call to action.
2. Portfolio (Maybe with sections or a filter system, I don't know)
    a. Design.
    b. Developer.
3. About me (job-hunt)
    a. About.
    b. Skill set.
    c. Downloadable CV (?).
4. Blog (Newsletter)
    a. Blog posts (with a tag system).
    b. Newsletter subscription (with prefered topics selection if possible).


# Optimization

1. Mobile first
2. Accesibilty
    a. Screen reader (Good descriptions for alt text, strength and emphasis tags, etc).
    b. Contrast Themes (Outline color of the focus state rather Transparent than 0 px).
    c. Color blind themes (/ preferences if possible).
    d. Preference reduced motion.
3. Keyboard Navigation (Focus state visible when an element is selected).
4. 1MB site (or as light as I can make it).
5. SEO
6. ...


# Features

• Hover navigation bar (opaque or glossy effect).
• Themes button; dark / light / color blind / high contrast / font size.
• Model-viewer (because I work on AR/3D solutions).
• "Blog post to Email HTML system subsription" (Don't know if it's a thing, yet).
• "Data visualization / interactive infography feeded with a post tag system" (idem). Now I'm thinking about an interactive infographic connected to a timeline; featuring how I went from a T to Pi-shaped skills, letting users to expand information and link projects... but, on second thought, my inner project manager & developer thinks it's a wat too much for me to handle..
